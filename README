Here are some tools for keeping supercomputers busy.

slaunch Job.sbatch 4

will launch 4 dependent instances of Job.sbatch.

It also launches a sidecar job for each one of these jobs,
to tar the result and plot every frame you made.

1.) put slaunch in your scripts directory.
2.) Copy Job.sbatch to your run directory.  Make it work for you.
3.) Put this repo in your repos, something like $HOME/repos/slaunch.
4.) Edit PlotAndTar.sbatch to point to the right tarme and plotme.  Or do something different.
5.) Feel free to make this better.
